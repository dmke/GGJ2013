# CARDIOCRAZY

Imagine the emergency ambulance being involved in an emergency itself: due to
a car crash, the ambulance fails to deliver Dash, the life-saving donor heart
and hero of the story, to its recipient. Self-conscious and willing to deliver
himself, Dash sprints the last miles to the hospital, jumping and dashing over
various obstacles.

As he gets weaker his time is running out, but fortunately there are vitamin
pills on the way that prolong his life.

Will he make it to the hospital? It's a matter of life and death, so hurry!
